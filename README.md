# mobie-demo

It's just a demonstration project about Mobie library. Feel free to release pull requests.

```
git clone https://github.com/ngmobie/mobie-demo.git
cd mobie-demo
npm install
bower install
npm start
```

Then, go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), or, if you want to use a different port, type:

```
PORT=XXXX npm start
```

Same to the 'www' folder, the default path is `platforms/browser/www`, but you can change the `WWW_FOLDER` environment variable, and use a different folder:

```
WWW_FOLDER=public npm start
```

And change `XXXX` to the port which you want to use.
